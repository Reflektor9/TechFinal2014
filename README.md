**Progress Report:**
================
*Basic Game Description*
The game will be a top down shooter where the player controls a spacehip with the W, A, S, and D.  He will have to avoid asteroids coming at him from all sides of the screen and shoot at them by holding down the left mouse button and aiming with the cursor.  The game will go until the player loses all of his shields at which point the game will tell him his score and return to the menu.  Here the player can play again or go to a store where he can buy items for use in the game.
