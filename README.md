Reflektor9 Spaceship Adventure
==============================================


Game Description/Instructions:

Click ‘Start’ on the Start screen, which will bring you to the Menu screen.
Here, you have two options; either to go to the store and buy power ups, or to continue and “launch” into space to play!

	The game is a top down shooter space adventure!

Asteroids and UFOs will come your way trying to end your journey. You must avoid them and shoot back to destroy them! The game runs until you lose all of your lives, at which point you will return to the menu screen

In order to buy anything from the store, you need money. At the store you can buy power ups like missiles and bombs! Missiles can be used as a one shot kill to your enemies, and bombs clear the screen of your enemies.

	By clicking “launch” you are sent off into space! Avoid the asteroids coming your way by using W, A, S, and D to move up, left, down, and right. Click the left mouse button to shoot and aim with the cursor.

	Power ups will appear on the screen as you play. Collect them by moving over them. Powerups include:
	- Shield: protects you from one attack 
	- Missile: can be shot and can kill an enemy with that one shot
	- Bomb: will clear the screen of enemies
	As mentioned, bombs and missiles can be purchased at the store. When you play the game again, your power ups will display in the bottom right corner. The game will tell you how many you have of each.
Shoot Missiles with the right mouse button, and press the space bar to use a bomb.

Once you lose all your lives and return to the menu screen, you can launch again, starting with a score of zero. You do not lose your money! You can spend it at the store or continue on collecting by playing again.
