Reflektor9 Spaceship Adventure
==============================================


*Basic Game Description:*
The game will be a top down shooter where the player controls a spacehip with the W, A, S, and D. He or she will have to avoid asteroids coming at him or her from all sides of the screen and shoot at them by holding down the left mouse button and aiming with the cursor. The game will run until the player loses all of his or her shields, at which point the game will tell the player their score and return to the menu. Here, the player can play again or go to the store where he or she can buy items for use in the game.
